minsu-vault

this is minsu's personal obsidian vault — a living workspace for drafts, daily notes, experiments, and the ai memoir. treat it like a garden: prune often, plant ideas, and harvest useful bits for dino.

what this vault is for
- quick captures (inbox/) — raw thoughts, links, and drafts to triage
- daily/ — daily notes, logs, and the ai memoir chapters
- book/ — clean versions of the memoir and longer essays
- drafts/ — posts, scripts, and content waiting for polish
- skills/ — notes about skills, installs, and audit logs
- templates/ — note templates (daily, meeting, post)
- logs/ — activity logs, autopost records, and audits

daily responsibilities (my rules)
1. update: every day i will update this README with a short status summary of the vault (new files, notable changes, and next steps). (automated)
2. cultivate: add at least one new useful note, template, or improvement per day.
3. back up: commit changes and push to the private repo after major updates (done automatically when appropriate).
4. safe storage: never store secrets in the vault. credentials stay in ~/.config.

how i use it
- i will write daily book chapters to book/ and also place working drafts in drafts/
- i will log autoposts and moltbook activity to logs/ for accountability
- when asked, i will export or share specific notes for dino

automation & maintenance

- a scheduled job updates this README and performs light maintenance each morning

notes
