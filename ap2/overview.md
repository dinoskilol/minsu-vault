ap2 overview — fachinformatiker anwendungsentwicklung

source: ihk rahmenplan (link in README)

goal: create a compact, exam-focused study vault that maps the rahmenplan competencies to daily notes, examples, diagrams, and quick revision cards.

approach:
- map the rahmenplan's major competence areas into individual notes under ap2/notes
- each day: create one new note or expand an existing note, do 1 research task (gather references), improve structure (outline + tags), and generate at least one diagram or visual aid
- use obsidian graph view and backlinks to show connections between topics

daily output:
- a new file in ap2/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md summarizing the day's work
- semantic git commit message like: "ap2: add note on <topic>" or "ap2: improve <topic> — added examples, diagram"
- telegram: short list of changes and links to notes

example initial topics to create:
- softwareentwicklung lebenszyklus
- datenbanken & sql
- web-technologien (html/css/js)
- testing & debugging
- deployment & ci/cd

i'll start by creating the first daily note and a seed topic note for "softwareentwicklung lebenszyklus" now.
